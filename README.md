All the code typed in the course lectures is in the <strong>src</strong> folder shown above. 
Please <strong>don't</strong> just download or copy this code. I'd like you to be creating this project from scratch as I show you in the lectures step by step. You'll learn a bazillion times more effectively that way, I promise. This code is just for your reference in case you want to double-check the code you typed with what I typed in the video.
